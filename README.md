# SuperMarioBoom
Super Mario Boom is a non-serious Mario fan game project I wrote in Feb 2016 - Mar 2016 as a joke game for April Fools 2016. Initially, I disguised it as a poorly written game but change the audience's low expectation to something better while entertaining. The gag in this game is that everything violently explode when something happens.

I have experimented with several features I have not done in the past:
- Collisions between multiple instance of objects on another moving object 
- Super Mario World styled goal and level end bonus game
- Levels generator by chunks

DISCLAIMER: This is a just for fun fan made open source project I never intended to make any profit from it. Mario and many elements in this belongs to Nintendo and other respective owners.
